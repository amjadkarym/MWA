1. Explain why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout?
setImmediate and setTimeout are the phases of event loop having priorities. The setImmediate
schedule a callback to run at check phase after the I/O and incomming: connection phases. So if 
it requires to callback operation execute after the I/O or connection we use the setImmediate 
instead of setTimeout.

2. Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate?
process.nextTick is an async operation which has prority over the setTimer and setImmediate
phases of the event loop. Which means it runs before timer fire in the subsequent ticks of the
event loop. setImmediate will schedule a callback to run at check phase of the event loop.
